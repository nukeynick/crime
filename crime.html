Using data taken over the Summer of 2014 for San Francisco's crime rates it is clear that the downtown police districts account for a far greater portion of the city's crime than the other zones.
This is true for all types of crime despite the fact that the downtown area is not very large and has two full police districts dedicated to its service.
I will briefly demonstrate this claim and discuss the implications and future plans for San Francisco's police department.
</p>

<h4><a id="rate" class="anchor" href="#rate" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>San Francisco Crime Rate</h4>

<p>
The criminal incident data covers the Summer of 2014, from June 1st to August 31st, a span of 92 days.
I was initially curious to see if there was any significant change to the amount of crime as the Summer went on.
I broke the data into 13 weeks, although this leaves one extra day at the end, and examined the total number of reported crimes per week.
</p>

<p>
Outside of weeks 2 and 13 the crime rate did not fluctuate significantly, over the whole Summer there was roughly 2030 crimes per week in the city.
It seems likely that crime rates do not change significantly over a single season.
Comparing the differences in crime rates between Summer and Winter would be a better comparison than what this data provides for.
Since examining the temporal nature of crime is not possible with this data set I turned to exmining the differences in geography.
</p>

<h5><a id="PdDistricts" class="anchor" href="#locs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Police District Crime Rates/h5>

<p>
The city of San Francisco is a diverse place, both ethnically and economically.
Certain parts of the city have higher mean incomes or higher rates of homelessness.
These are the types of variables that can be used to predict crimes, although they are not readily available for this study.
The data provide several ways of determining geography including basic x and y coordinates (latitude and longitude), street intersections, and Police District.
I chose to use Police Districts since I assumed they were already drawn to map out specific neighborhoods within the city.
The city has <a href="https://hoodwork-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/story/image/10247/sfpdfinal.png">10 districts</a> and their borders tend to agree with the community borders of the people living there.
From the map it can be seen that the districts are all of different sizes and therefore contain different population numbers.
To account for that I located a <a href="http://sanfranciscopolice.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/14683-SFPD_DSBAfinal_trnsmtl.pdf">2008 police district report</a> which, among other things, contained the population living in each district.
I used these numbers to normalize the crime rate to number of crimes per 10,000 people.
Of course the 2008 information is out of date but as long as the city's demographics have not changed significantly they can still be used to provide useful comparisons.
I then broke the data down further into specific crimes, there are 34 crimes in the data but the top 7 crimes account for 78&#37 of all crimes.
As a quick comparison I will show the crime rate per district for Larceny/Theft (the top crime) as a gross number (without dividing by the population) and the relative number (number of crimes per 10,000 people).

<p>
From these bar charts it is obivious that the Southern district has the largest amount of theft, and in total number the Central and Northern districts are close behind.
However, when the population is taken into account most of the districts have significantly less crime than the Southern district, with the exception of the Tenderloin.
This will become a common theme as the Tenderloin and Southern districts have much lower populations and yet they are responsible for a proportionally larger amount of crime.
Meanwhile, the Taraval, Ingleside, and Mission districts have much higher populations and a proportionally smaller amount of the crime.
</p>

<img src="/data/VT.png" alt="car theft" class="inline"/>

<p>
Vehicle Theft is the only one of the top 7 crimes where the Southern and Tenderloin districts do not dominate the statistics.
Instead there is significant representation from Bayview and the Mission, although Southern still controls the largest proportion of crime.
I have also included the other crime rate plots for the top 7 below.

<p>
These data require some further understanding before conclusions can be drawn.
The Tenderloin district lies close to the heart of downtown San Francisco and does not have many residents, most of that area is business related.
The Southern district, which is simply the area south of downtown and not the southern most part of the city, contains the baseball stadium and a lot of tourist and nightlife related facilities.
It seems likely that criminals would be attracted to these areas since they are where tourists might visit, and tourists make easier targets for criminals.
This is acknowledged in the 2008 report on San Francisco's police districts, which early on establishes that the city's northeastern region is the center of criminal activity.
But what should be done about this?
The downtown area has two police districts dedicated to it and its small population yet crime is still high.
In the 2008 report the final conclusion urges consolidating the 10 districts into 5 with the downtown area split between the two smallest propsed districts.
Assuming that all districts receive equivalent resources in manpower and equipment this change would increase the police presence in the downtown area without sacrificing other districts.
However, as of this time the only changes to the police districts has been some minor exchange of territory between the existing districts and so the problem continues.
